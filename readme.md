# Flask Blog
Here I built a blog using flask, python, boostrap, sqlalchemy, and sqlite

x. The scope of this project Covers: 
- Flask ManyToMany relationship
- Migrations with Flask-Migrate
- Updating posts via HTML-forms.
- Blog has a basic search
- Pagination
- Admin panel with Flask-Admin
- Access control with Flask-Security
- Custom 404 error page
- Custom CSS for small login/logout panel

x. Road blocks
- Due to sdk/site package appreciation it was difficult figuring out authentication
